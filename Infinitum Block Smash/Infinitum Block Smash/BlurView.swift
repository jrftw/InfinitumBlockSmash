/*
 * BlurView.swift
 * 
 * SWIFTUI BLUR EFFECT WRAPPER
 * 
 * This SwiftUI view provides a wrapper for UIKit's blur effects, enabling
 * visual blur effects throughout the Infinitum Block Smash app. It serves
 * as a bridge between SwiftUI and UIKit's visual effect system.
 * 
 * KEY RESPONSIBILITIES:
 * - SwiftUI integration with UIKit blur effects
 * - Visual blur effect rendering
 * - Dynamic blur style updates
 * - Cross-platform blur support
 * - Performance-optimized blur rendering
 * - Accessibility-compatible blur effects
 * 
 * MAJOR DEPENDENCIES:
 * - SwiftUI: Core UI framework
 * - UIKit: Blur effect implementation
 * - UIVisualEffectView: Native blur rendering
 * - UIBlurEffect: Blur effect styling
 * 
 * BLUR FEATURES:
 * - Dynamic Blur Styles: System-defined blur effects
 * - Real-time Updates: Live blur style changes
 * - Performance Optimization: Native blur rendering
 * - Accessibility Support: VoiceOver compatibility
 * - Cross-Platform Consistency: iOS blur standards
 * 
 * BLUR STYLES SUPPORTED:
 * - .systemUltraThinMaterial: Ultra-thin blur effect
 * - .systemThinMaterial: Thin blur effect
 * - .systemMaterial: Standard blur effect
 * - .systemThickMaterial: Thick blur effect
 * - .systemChromeMaterial: Chrome-style blur
 * - .regular: Regular blur effect
 * - .prominent: Prominent blur effect
 * 
 * INTEGRATION POINTS:
 * - Authentication views for background blur
 * - Modal overlays for content blur
 * - Settings panels for visual effects
 * - Game overlays for UI blur
 * - Navigation elements for depth
 * 
 * PERFORMANCE FEATURES:
 * - Native UIKit blur rendering
 * - Efficient blur style updates
 * - Optimized memory usage
 * - Hardware-accelerated blur
 * 
 * USER EXPERIENCE:
 * - Smooth blur transitions
 * - Consistent visual effects
 * - Modern iOS design language
 * - Accessibility compliance
 * 
 * ARCHITECTURE ROLE:
 * This view acts as a simple bridge between SwiftUI and UIKit's
 * blur effect system, providing consistent blur effects across
 * the application.
 * 
 * THREADING CONSIDERATIONS:
 * - UI updates on main thread
 * - Thread-safe blur style updates
 * - Safe blur effect rendering
 * 
 * PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS:
 * - Native blur performance
 * - Efficient style updates
 * - Memory-efficient rendering
 * 
 * REVIEW NOTES:
 * - Verify blur effect rendering performance
 * - Check blur style updates and transitions
 * - Test blur effects on different iOS versions
 * - Validate blur accessibility compliance
 * - Check blur performance on low-end devices
 * - Test blur effects during heavy game operations
 * - Verify blur style consistency across app
 * - Check blur memory usage and optimization
 * - Test blur effects during app background/foreground
 * - Validate blur integration with theme system
 * - Check blur effects on different screen sizes
 * - Test blur performance during animations
 * - Verify blur effect quality and visual appeal
 * - Check blur compatibility with dark/light modes
 * - Test blur effects during memory pressure
 * - Validate blur integration with SwiftUI animations
 * - Check blur effects on different device orientations
 * - Test blur performance during rapid UI updates
 * - Verify blur effect consistency with iOS design guidelines
 * - Check blur integration with other visual effects
