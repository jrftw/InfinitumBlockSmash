### 2. Adaptive Quality Management System

**File**: `Game/GameMechanics/AdaptiveQualityManager.swift` (New)

**Features**:
- **5 Quality Levels**: Ultra, High, Medium, Low, Minimal
- **Dynamic Quality Adjustment**: Automatically switches quality based on conditions
- **Particle Effect Control**: Disables or reduces particle intensity under stress
- **Background Animation Control**: Pauses background animations when needed
- **Texture Quality Management**: Adjusts texture quality based on device capabilities

**Quality Level Logic**:
- **Ultra**: Full effects, 120 FPS (only on high-end devices)
- **High**: Full effects, 60 FPS (default for most devices)
- **Medium**: Reduced effects, 60 FPS, no background animations
- **Low**: No particles, 30 FPS, minimal effects
- **Minimal**: No effects, 30 FPS, essential gameplay only

### 3. GameScene Thermal Integration

**File**: `Game/GameScene/GameScene.swift`

**Changes**:
- **Thermal-Aware FPS**: Uses `getThermalAwareFPS()` instead of target FPS
- **Background Animation Control**: Pauses animations under thermal stress
- **Particle Effect Optimization**: Aggressive particle reduction under stress
- **Quality Settings Integration**: Responds to adaptive quality changes
- **Periodic Thermal Monitoring**: Checks conditions every 5 seconds

**Particle Optimization**:
- **Critical Thermal**: 80% reduction in particle effects
- **Serious Thermal**: 60% reduction in particle effects
- **Low Battery**: Additional 30-70% reduction based on battery level
- **Low Power Mode**: 40% additional reduction

### 4. Particle Effect Management

**Enhanced Methods**:
- `optimizeParticleEmitter()`: Now considers thermal state and battery level
- `playComboAnimation()`: Checks quality settings before creating particles
- `addParticleEffect()`: Respects adaptive quality settings
- `setupParticles()`: Background particles respect quality settings

**Particle Limits**:
- Maximum 15 particles per second (down from 25)
- Maximum 0.5 second lifetime (down from 0.8)
- Maximum 4x4 pixel size (down from 6x6)
- Maximum 40% opacity (down from 60%)

### 5. Background Animation Control

**Enhanced Method**: `setBackgroundAnimationsActive()`

**Features**:
- **Thermal Pause**: Automatically pauses background animations under thermal stress
- **Battery Pause**: Pauses animations when battery is low
- **Low Power Pause**: Pauses animations in low power mode
- **Logging**: Provides detailed logging of animation state changes

## Performance Reduction Triggers

### Thermal State Triggers
- **Critical**: 50% FPS reduction, minimal quality, no particles
- **Serious**: 30% FPS reduction, low quality, reduced particles
- **Fair**: 15% FPS reduction, medium quality
- **Nominal**: No reduction, high quality

### Battery Level Triggers
- **Below 10%**: 50% FPS reduction, minimal quality
- **Below 20%**: 30% FPS reduction, low quality

- Lower quality defaults
- Additional thermal sensitivity

### High-End Devices
- Support for 120 FPS and unlimited FPS
- Better thermal management capabilities
- Higher quality defaults
- Less aggressive optimization

## Monitoring and Logging
