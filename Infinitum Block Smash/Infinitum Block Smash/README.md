## üì± Requirements

- iOS 15.0+
- Xcode 14.0+
- Swift 5.7+
- Firebase project setup
- Apple Developer Account (for distribution)

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd "Infinitum Block Smash"
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
The project uses Swift Package Manager for dependencies. Dependencies will be automatically resolved when you open the project in Xcode.

### 3. Firebase Setup
1. Create a Firebase project
2. Add an iOS app to your Firebase project
3. Download `GoogleService-Info.plist` and place it in the `Config/` directory
4. Enable the following Firebase services:
   - Authentication
   - Firestore Database
   - Realtime Database
   - Analytics
   - Crashlytics
   - Remote Config
   - Cloud Messaging

### 4. Build and Run
1. Open `Infinitum Block Smash.xcodeproj` in Xcode
2. Select your target device or simulator
3. Build and run the project

## üß™ Development

### Debug System
The app includes a comprehensive debug system accessible in DEBUG builds:
- Go to Settings ‚Üí Debug Manager
- Enable debug features for development
- Use device simulation for testing different device constraints

### Device Simulation
Test your app with realistic device constraints:
- Memory limitations based on actual device RAM
- Performance constraints matching real devices
- Thermal throttling simulation

### Memory Management
The app includes sophisticated memory management:
- Automatic memory cleanup every 60 seconds
- Memory pressure detection and response
- Leak detection and reporting

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
The app automatically detects the build environment:
- **DEBUG**: Full debug features and verbose logging
- **RELEASE**: Minimal logging and optimized performance

### Firebase Configuration
All Firebase configuration is handled in `Config/GoogleService-Info.plist` and the app automatically configures services based on the environment.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Build Issues
If you encounter build conflicts, run:
```bash
./Scripts/clean_build_conflicts.sh
```

### Memory Issues
The app includes comprehensive memory management, but if you encounter issues:
1. Check the debug logs for memory warnings
2. Use the device simulation to test with memory constraints
3. Review the memory optimization documentation

### Performance Issues
1. Enable debug mode to monitor performance
2. Check thermal optimization settings
3. Use device simulation to test on different device types
