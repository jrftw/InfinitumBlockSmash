/*
 * PURPOSE:
 * Defines the core game board data structure that manages the game grid
 * and block tray. This class provides the foundational data model for
 * the game's spatial layout and block management system.
 *
 * KEY RESPONSIBILITIES:
 * - Game grid data structure definition and management
 * - Block tray storage and organization
 * - Grid initialization and configuration
 * - Spatial data management for block placement
 * - Game board state representation
 * - Block inventory management
 * - Grid size configuration and validation
 * - Data structure optimization for performance
 *
 * MAJOR DEPENDENCIES:
 * - Block.swift: Block data model and properties
 * - GameConstants.swift: Grid size and configuration constants
 * - Foundation: Core framework for data structures
 * - SwiftUI: UI framework for data binding
 *
 * EXTERNAL FRAMEWORKS USED:
 * - Foundation: Core framework for data structures
 * - SwiftUI: Modern UI framework for data binding
 *
 * ARCHITECTURE ROLE:
 * Acts as the foundational data model for the game's spatial
 * layout, providing the core structure for grid management
 * and block organization.
 *
 * CRITICAL ORDER / EXECUTION NOTES:
 * - Grid must be properly initialized with correct dimensions
 * - Block tray must be managed efficiently for performance
 * - Data structure should support efficient spatial queries
 * - Memory management should be optimized for large grids
