# Device Simulation System

This document explains how to use the new device simulation system to test your app with realistic device constraints when running in the iOS Simulator.

## Overview

The device simulation system allows you to test your app as if it were running on different iPhone models with their actual memory constraints, CPU limitations, and performance characteristics. This helps you identify and fix performance issues before they reach real users.

## Features

### Memory Constraints
- **Realistic Memory Limits**: Each simulated device has its actual RAM capacity
- **Memory Pressure Simulation**: Tracks memory usage and applies pressure thresholds
- **Dynamic Cleanup**: More aggressive memory management for low-end devices

### Performance Constraints
- **FPS Limitations**: Respects device-specific refresh rates (30/60/120 FPS)
- **Thermal Throttling**: Simulates CPU throttling based on usage
- **Low-end Device Detection**: Special optimizations for older devices

### Device Support
The system supports all major iPhone models from iPhone SE (1st gen) to iPhone 16 Pro Max, including:
- **Low-end devices**: iPhone SE series, iPhone 6s-8 series (2-3GB RAM)
- **Mid-range devices**: iPhone X-13 series (3-6GB RAM)
- **High-end devices**: iPhone 14-16 Pro series (6-8GB RAM)

## How to Use

### 1. Access the Debug Interface
When running in the iOS Simulator:
1. Launch your app
2. Sign in to your account
3. Tap the "Device Simulation" button in the main menu
4. This will open the device simulation debug interface

### 2. Monitor Device Status
The debug interface shows:
- **Device Information**: Current simulated device model and specifications
- **Memory Status**: Real-time memory usage and pressure levels
- **Performance Status**: CPU usage, thermal throttling, and performance limitations
- **FPS Information**: Current, target, and recommended frame rates
- **Recommendations**: Performance optimization suggestions

### 3. Test Different Scenarios
The system automatically:
- **Simulates Memory Pressure**: As your app uses more memory, pressure increases
- **Applies Thermal Throttling**: High CPU usage triggers performance limitations
- **Adjusts FPS**: Automatically reduces frame rates under stress
- **Provides Recommendations**: Suggests optimizations based on current conditions
